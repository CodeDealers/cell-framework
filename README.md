# The Cell framework 
Microservice framework
My goal is to create an immutable architecture which can handle quick development cycles
, changes to code and isolate developers to a simple framework where they can code however they want

Take our body for example which is in fact an immutable artifact with every single single cell being
disposable at any given time 

If we can create an architecture that resembles the human body where code lives, dies and
can sustain the host (The software ecosystem) We can have a development cycle where
code can be instantly creates or duplicated independent of hardware and dependencies 
and evolved to support new functionality organically
